## Installation Instructions

1. Download the latest version of [ZHMModSDK](https://github.com/OrfeasZ/ZHMModSDK) and install it.
2. Download the latest version of `bomboclat` and copy it to the ZHMModSDK `mods` folder (e.g. `C:\Games\HITMAN 3\Retail\mods`). You just need to copy the bomboclat.dll file, nothing else.

4. Enjoy!
